Official ReactJS tutorial writen in ES6


**feature :** 

- ReactJS (> 0.14)
- ES6 (*or ES2015 as it is now called since recent time*)
- jspm (*System JS and jspm = speed of light workflow from zero*)
  - more information on using jspm with react : [in this nice article](http://www.newmediacampaigns.com/blog/refactoring-react-components-to-es6-classes) 
- babel (<6)



##Intallation :
```bash
npm install && jspm install
```


##Launch
```bash
jspm-server
```

>navigator should automatically open with `jspm-server` command. Otherwise just go `http://localhost:8080`

##Credits 

- Facebook : for this super nice ReactJS which triggered a lot of positive evolution in the javascript world
- Guy Bedford : who gave us system js and jspm [jspm.io](http://jspm.io/)
